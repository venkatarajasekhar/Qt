    \brief The QTcpSocket class provides a TCP socket.

    \reentrant
    \ingroup network
    \inmodule QtNetwork

    TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable,
    stream-oriented, connection-oriented transport protocol. It is
    especially well suited for continuous transmission of data.

    QTcpSocket is a convenience subclass of QAbstractSocket that
    allows you to establish a TCP connection and transfer streams of
    data. See the QAbstractSocket documentation for details.

    \note TCP sockets cannot be opened in QIODevice::Unbuffered mode.
